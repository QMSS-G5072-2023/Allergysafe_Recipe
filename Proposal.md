### Final Project Proposal
#### Zheyi Zeng

### Name of Project:
Allergy-Safe Recipe Explorer
### Type of Project:
API Client (Option A)
### Brief Description of the Purpose:
The Allergy-Safe Recipe Explorer is a Python package designed to facilitate easy access to recipes and nutritional information, specifically catering to individuals with food allergies. This package will utilize the Spoonacular API to provide users with recipes that are safe for their specific dietary needs, offering advanced filtering, nutritional breakdowns, cost estimations, and more.


### Link to API:
Spoonacular API: https://spoonacular.com/food-api
### Authentication: 
The API requires an API key for access, which can be obtained through free sign-up.

## Technical Steps / Challenges
### API Interaction: 
Establish connection to Spoonacular API for recipe data retrieval, ensuring efficient handling of responses.
### Advanced Filtering: 
Implement advanced recipe search and filtering based on allergens, diet types, and cuisine.
### Image Integration: 
Incorporate recipe and ingredient images, enhancing user engagement and experience.
### Nutritional Analysis: 
Provide a detailed nutritional breakdown for recipes, including cost estimation for budgeting purposes.
### Interactive Instructions: 
Offer step-by-step cooking instructions with text-to-speech functionality for hands-free guidance.
### Ingredient-Based Suggestions: 
Develop a feature for recipe suggestions based on available ingredients, aiming to reduce food waste.
### Customized Meal Planning: 
Create personalized meal plans considering dietary restrictions and allergy requirements.
### Data Transformation: 
Efficiently transform JSON API responses into a structured and user-friendly format.
### Data Cleaning: 
Ensure data reliability through thorough cleaning and validation processes.

## Potential Hurdles and Solutions
### Complex Filtering Logic: 
Developing accurate filtering algorithms for allergens and dietary preferences. Solution: Rigorous testing and user feedback for continual refinement.
### API Rate Limits: 
Managing request limitations within the Spoonacular API's free tier. Solution: Implement efficient querying and caching techniques.
### Data Quality and Consistency: 
Ensuring the accuracy of nutritional and allergen information.
### Solution: 
Regular updates and cross-referencing with additional data sources.

The project will employ skills in data acquisition, parsing, transformation, and cleaning, as learned in the course.
Emphasis will be placed on creating a user-friendly experience, with comprehensive documentation and practical examples provided in Jupyter notebooks.
